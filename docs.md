To create a simple but visually appealing transition animation between two HTML pages, you can use CSS animations and transitions. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this, explained as if you were a first-year university student:

1. **Create the HTML Pages:**

   You already have two HTML pages: `starting_page.html` and `target_page.html`. These will be the starting and target pages for the transition.

2. **Add Stylesheet for Animation:**

   Create a new CSS file (e.g., `styles.css`) or update your existing one to define the animation styles. Here's a basic example to get you started:

   ```css
   /* styles.css */

   body {
     transition: opacity 0.5s; /* Add a smooth transition effect to the whole body */
   }

   /* Hide the body initially */
   body.hide {
     opacity: 0;
   }
   ```

   This CSS defines a transition effect for the `body` element's opacity, which will make it gradually fade in or out over 0.5 seconds.

3. **Update JavaScript to Trigger Transition:**

   Update your JavaScript code to trigger the transition when a link is clicked. Modify your `script.js` file as follows:

   ```javascript
   // script.js

   function test(event) {
     let xMouse = event.clientX - 8;
     let yMouse = event.clientY - 8;
     text = "X: " + xMouse + " Y: " + yMouse;
     document.getElementById("test").innerHTML = text;
   }

   function goToTargetPage() {
     // Add the "hide" class to the body to trigger the fade-out animation
     document.body.classList.add("hide");

     // After a delay (0.5 seconds, matching the CSS transition duration), navigate to the target page
     setTimeout(function () {
       window.location.href = "target_page.html";
     }, 500); // 500 milliseconds
   }
   ```

   In this code, we add the "hide" class to the body element to trigger the fade-out animation. After a short delay (0.5 seconds, matching the CSS transition duration), we navigate to the target page using `window.location.href`.

4. **Update HTML Links:**

   Update the links in your `starting_page.html` to call the `goToTargetPage()` function when clicked. Modify your anchor tags like this:

   ```html
   <a id="startLink" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="goToTargetPage()">Start!</a>
   ```

   This will prevent the default behavior of the anchor (navigating to a new page) and instead trigger the JavaScript function to initiate the animation and page transition.

5. **Testing and Understanding:**

   When you click the "Start!" link on the starting page, the page should gradually fade out and then navigate to the target page. This creates a simple but visually appealing transition.

   To understand and debug the code:

   - The CSS defines the animation properties (fade-in and fade-out).
   - JavaScript handles the click event and initiates the transition.
   - Use your browser's Developer Tools (F12 or right-click and inspect) to view console messages and inspect elements for debugging.

By following these steps, you should be able to create a smooth transition animation between your starting and target pages, and you'll have a better understanding of how it works.
